tessellation
============

A drawing tool similar to Hexels, wherein the base graphical unit is not a traditional grid-aligned square pixel, but rather a custom tiled object such as a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees).

Based off of the cover design of the 1959.12 issue of Typographische Monatsbl√§tter.
